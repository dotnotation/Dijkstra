# Dijkstra
Coursework for Colt Steele's JS Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

Dijkstra's Algorithm 
    - Dijkstra's shortest path 
    - acts upon a graph
    - uses priority queue as part of its implementation (see binary heap)
    - what is it?
        - one of the most famous and widely used
        - finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph
    - Edsger Dijkstra
        - Dutch programmer
        - physicist, essayist
        - one of the most influential, cited, and used research
        - known for DJP, call stack, Guarded Command Language, weakest precondition calculus, separation of concerns, software architecture, concurrent programming, multithreaded programming, structured programming, and so much more
